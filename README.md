- 👋 Hi, I’m @cwybalbosa. You can call me Sea. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to attract the right type of candidates (local, in office) for the job positions I have for our Canadian company. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I really don't know much about the IT world. I would like to start with learning more about SharePoint, Nintex and Promapp. Non-work related, I am working on my Hot Yoga Teaching cerification through YYoga. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on speaking to experts in the IT industry about how technology has changed and how to stay relevant with all the continuous changes. 
- 📫 How to reach me chelsea.balbosa@elantis.com
